        So much that I want to tell you, yet I dont know where to start. 
        <br> Thanks for loving me, and for showing your love for me in so many different non-verbal ways. I really really appreciate every small (or big) things you do for me, like buying chocolates for me.
        Thanks for being the responsible one, feeling like you need to be the one thinking for us, thinking for our future. 
        This period of time have been and will be very difficult for us. I know it is especially hard for you, that you feel like you need to be the one making the important decisions.
        I'm sorry for being so hopeful, sorry for doing things that makes it so much more difficult for you. 
        I will try not to make requests that will disrupt your thoughts. 
        I'm sorry for sometimes wanting to run away from all these problems. haha sometimes I do wish God will just solve my problems immediately cause I'm too lazy to face them.
        Anyway, I'm not sure how our future will be like but I will support you always :D haha and all the best to your journey in discovering the truth with regards to religion. I will pray for you regardless.
        I love you.
